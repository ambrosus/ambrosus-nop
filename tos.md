These terms of use (**Terms**) govern the use of validator nodes (Apollo **Masternodes**) on Ambrosus Main Network (**AMB-NET**) and a digital bridge connecting AMB-NET to Ethereum Main-Net for the purposes of transferring digital tokens, Amber (**AMB**) between the two blockchain networks in order to activate an Apollo Masternode (**Onboarding**) as described below and form a legally binding agreement between us, Ambrosus Inc, a limited corporation registered in Belize with company number 172511, with registered office at New Horizon Building, Ground Floor, 3 1/2 Miles Philip S.W. Goldson Highway, Belize City, Belize C.A. (**we**, **us**,** our**) and you, the operator of masternode (**you**,** user**). Where the masternode is being used by or on behalf of a company or other legal entity, all references in these Terms to "you" or "user" are to such entity and these Terms are entered into between us and that entity.

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time without notice. It is your responsibility to review these terms prior to operating of masternodeI as your use of the ABI constitutes your acceptance of the Terms as modified from time to time.
